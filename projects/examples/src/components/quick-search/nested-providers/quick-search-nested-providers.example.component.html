<button class="btn" (click)="spotlightOpen = !spotlightOpen">Press to show Quick Search</button>

<p>
    Quick search gives the client to register nested sections on-top-of normal sections. A nested section is a simple
    group of quick search providers that has a section name.
</p>
<br />
These sections can be ordered amongst each-other, but will always display below normal quick search providers.
